# Contributing to Prison
Thank you for deciding to contribute to the Prison project. In order to ensure that we create a
high quality, open, and active project, we have defined contribution guidelines for those who are
contributing bug reports, suggestions, translations, and code contributions.

## Bug Reports
Reporting bugs you encounter is important to ensure that we can find and destroy them. To report
a bug, you should [go to the issue creator](https://github.com/MC-Prison/Prison/issues/new) and
give it a descriptive title. You should also fill in the template that is provided for you so that
we can quickly figure out what's wrong and put a stop to it. Once you click "Submit new issue," you
will be taken to your newly created issue page!

You should keep checking this issue page often because we will probably ask for more information,
or give you suggestions or fixes.

## Feature Suggestions
The process for suggesting features is similar to the process for reporting bugs. You will
[create a new issue](https://github.com/MC-Prison/Prison/issues/new), and give your feature a
descriptive title. The difference is that you should **remove the template text**, because it 
doesn't adhere to feature suggestions. You should try to describe which feature you want in detail,
and you should check your issue page often because we will probably ask questions, discuss it,
and decide if we're going to add it.

If we accept your suggestion, it will be added to a Milestone for the next release.

## Translations
At this time, Prison's localization system is not yet complete. We hope to complete the system soon,
so that Prison can be used by non-English speakers.

## Code Contributions
Code contributions are a great way to help out and ensure that Prison keeps growing as a project.
We have strict guidelines in place to ensure uniformity, readability, and efficiency across the codebase.
We have outlined these in detail [on our wiki's Design Guidelines page](https://github.com/MC-Prison/Prison/wiki/Design-Guidelines). You can also use the 
[wiki](https://github.com/MC-Prison/Prison/wiki/) to learn how to use extensive Prison API.
